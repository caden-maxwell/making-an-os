# GDT - The Global Descriptor Table

## Segment Descriptors

An 8-byte structure that defines a protected-mode segment. It
has the following properties:
- Base address of 32 bits, defining where a segment begins in physical memory
- Segment limit of 20 bits, defining the size of a segment
- Other flags affecting how the CPU interprets the segment

*Note that the base address and segment limit are actually fragmented

## Basic Flat Model

The simplest workable configuration of segment registers, where we have
two overlapping segments of addressable memory for *code* and *data*

### The *code* Segment

- Base Address: `0x00000000`
- Segment Limit: `0xfffff`
- Segment Present: `1` - since segment is present in memory; used for virtual memory
- Descriptor Privilege Level: `0` - the highest privilege
- Descriptor Type: `1` - 1 for code and data segment, 0 is used for traps
- Segment Type: (`1010` or `0xa`)
    - Code: `1` - This is a code segment
    - Conforming: `0` - Non-conforming means code in a segment with a lower privilege may not call code in this segment - key to memory protection
    - Readable: `1` - Allows us to read constants defined in the code, 0 if execute-only. 
    - Accessed: `0` - Often used for debugging and virtual memory techniques, since the CPU sets the bit when it accesses the segment
- Other flags: (`1100` or `0xc`)
    - Granularity: `1` - Multiplies our limit by 4K (i.e. $16\cdot 16\cdot 16$), so our `0xfffff` would become `0xfffff000` (i.e. shift 3 hex digits to the left), allowing our segment to span 4Gb of memory
    - 32-bit default: `1` - Our segment will hold 32-bit code, otherwise weâ€™d use 0 for 16-bit code. This actually sets the default data unit size for operations (e.g. `push 0x4` would expand to a 32-bit number, etc.)
    - 64-bit code segment: `0` - Unused on 32-bit processor
    - AVL: `0` - We can set this for our own uses (e.g. debugging) but we will not use it

So, the segment descriptor for the *code* segment looks like:
```bin
00 cf 9a 00
00 00 ff ff
```

### The *data* Segment

Identical to the *code* segment, aside from the following segment type:
- Segment Type: (`0010` or `0x2`)
    - Code: `0` for data
    - Expand down: `0` - If clear, the segment expands from base address up to `base+limit`. If set, it expands from maximum offset down to limit, a behavior usually used for stacks
    - Writable: `1` - Allows the *data* segment to be written to, otherwise read-only
    - Accessed: `0` - Same as the *code* segment

So, the segment descriptor for the *data* segment looks like, with the `a` swapped for a `2`:
```bin
00 cf 92 00
00 00 ff ff
```
