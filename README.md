# Creating an Operating System

A simple operating system, written from scratch.

## Introduction

Welcome to my humble attempt at creating an operating system! This project is driven by nothing more than a curiosity to explore low-level programming and gain a deeper understanding of how computers operate behind the scenes; it's not something I intend to spend a prolonged period of time on, and will likely be very limited in its capabilities. I'm far from being an expert, but I'm excited to take a deep dive into the basics of operating system development and see what I can uncover along the way.
